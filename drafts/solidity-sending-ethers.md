# 🔐 Understanding `call`, `transfer`, `send`, `receive`, `fallback` and Reentrancy in Solidity

Solidity provides multiple ways to transfer Ether between contracts or to external accounts, and each has unique characteristics. In this post, we’ll explore the differences between `transfer`, `send`, and `call`, dive into how `receive()` and `fallback()` functions work, and explain the security concern of **reentrancy** with practical examples.

## 📤 Ether Transfer Methods: `transfer`, `send`, and `call`

### ✅ `transfer`

```solidity
payable(msg.sender).transfer(1 ether);
```

- **Automatically reverts on failure**
- **2300 gas limit** is forwarded to the recipient
- Simple and safe for external accounts (EOAs)
- **No longer recommended** for contracts due to gas limit issues

### ✅ `send`

```solidity
bool success = payable(msg.sender).send(1 ether);
require(success, "Send failed");
```

- Returns a boolean (`true`/`false`) instead of reverting
- Also forwards **only 2300 gas**
- Not recommended due to potential silent failures

### ✅ `call` (Recommended)

```solidity
(bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: 1 ether}("");
require(success, "Call failed");
```

- **Most flexible and recommended**
- Forwards **all available gas** (unless specified)
- Can also invoke functions via ABI
- Requires **manual success check**
- Must be used carefully to prevent **reentrancy attacks**

## ⚠️ What’s the Deal with 2300 Gas?

When using `transfer` or `send`, the receiving contract only gets **2300 gas** to execute any logic in its `receive()` or `fallback()` function. That’s barely enough to emit an event.

If the receiving contract tries to do anything more complex—like calling another contract, writing to storage, or performing loops—it will **fail due to out-of-gas**.

> 🔁 That’s why `call` is preferred—it doesn’t impose that limit.

## 🧠 `receive()` vs `fallback()` Functions

When a contract receives Ether, Solidity decides which function to trigger:

| Scenario | Triggered Function |
|----------|--------------------|
| Ether sent with **no data**, `receive()` defined | ✅ `receive()` |
| Ether sent with **data**, `fallback()` defined | ✅ `fallback()` |
| `receive()` not defined | ✅ `fallback()` (if payable) |
| Function call to undefined function | ✅ `fallback()` |

### Example:

```solidity
receive() external payable {
    emit Log("receive called");
}

fallback() external payable {
    emit Log("fallback called");
}
```

```solidity
// No data → triggers `receive()`
call{value: 1 ether}("");

// With data → triggers `fallback()`
call{value: 1 ether}(abi.encodeWithSignature("nonexistentFunction()"));
```

## 🔓 Reentrancy Attack & How to Prevent It

### 🧨 Vulnerable Pattern

```solidity
function withdraw() public {
    uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success, "Call failed");
    balances[msg.sender] = 0;
}
```

If the recipient is a contract and its `fallback()` or `receive()` calls `withdraw()` again, it could drain the funds **before** the balance is reset.

### ✅ Safe Pattern: Checks → Effects → Interactions

```solidity
function withdraw() public nonReentrant {
    uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
    balances[msg.sender] = 0; // Effects first!
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success, "Call failed");
}
```

Or use OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`:

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract SecureContract is ReentrancyGuard {
    function withdraw() public nonReentrant {
        ...
    }
}
```

## 🔁 Summary Table

| Method   | Gas Limit | Reverts on Failure | Supports Contracts | Reentrancy Safe? | Recommended |
|----------|-----------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------|
| `transfer` | 2300      | ✅ Yes             | ❌ Limited           | ✅ Mostly        | ❌ No        |
| `send`     | 2300      | ❌ No (returns bool) | ❌ Limited        | ❌ Risky         | ❌ No        |
| `call`     | Unlimited | ❌ No (check manually) | ✅ Yes         | ❌ Unless guarded | ✅ Yes       |
